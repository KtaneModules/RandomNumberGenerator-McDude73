  Title: Needy Random Number Generator
  Description: '[i]We are now at the mercy of RNGesus.[/i]


    Another needy module for KTaNE. Thank lumbud84 for suggesting this idea to be
    in the game, because I had fun working on it as much as he did on writing the
    manual for it.


    HTML Manual: Currently in progress. When manual is ready, ths module will go completely
    public.
